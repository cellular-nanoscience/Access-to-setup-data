1. Add this script to the folder with your .Dat files from Gleipnir setup from the calibration.vi in the folder it should be only .Dat files
2. Filenames: use in the filename deafould naming as {Specific name} {laser: "1064 nm" or  "976 nm"} {Laser power in mW in focus}.DAT
   Examples: PS 300 01 1064nm 45mW.DAT - Polysterine Beads with size 300nm measured with 1064nm laser with 45 mW in focus
             PS 500 07 976nm 37mW.DAT - Polysterine Beads with size 500nm measured with 976nm laser with 37 mW in focus
             Silicon 02 1064 40mW .DAT - Silicomn Beads measured with 1064nm laser with 40 mW in focus
   How it will read this naming by deafoult: B02.DAT - Sample B01 with 1064nm laser with 90 mW in focus
